Learn Docker

Commands::

Running an image 
$ docker run hello-world

run -> Run image to create container

On running this command it will first search in local
if not found
it will search in docker repo and download it

Ex:: We download an ubuntu image and want to play with it
we use
$ docker run -it ubuntu

-it -> It says run image in interactive mode
like open ubuntu terminal after creating container

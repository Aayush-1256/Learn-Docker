Learn Docker

Commands::

Running an image 
$ docker run hello-world

run -> Run image to create container

On running this command it will first search in local
if not found
it will search in docker repo and download it

Ex:: We download an ubuntu image and want to play with it
we use
$ docker run -it ubuntu

-it -> It says run image in interactive mode
like open ubuntu terminal after creating container


To list all images present
$ docker images

To download an image (it fetches the latest version)
$ docker pull name


To download image of specific verison
docker pull name:1.0.1

Ex-> docker pull ubuntu:16.04


To get list of all containers running

$ docker ps (ps means process status)

$ docker container ls (does same show list of containers)

If you run an image and after that you want to make it interactive
like you run ubuntu image without -it

$ docker container exec -it container-id bash(it can be find by above cmd docker ps or container ls)

bash -> what you want to run like for ubnntu image we want to run bash

To stop container
$ docker stop container-id

To list all stopped container details
$ docker ps -a

To all details of container
$ docker inspect container-id

To get all logs(like all cmd entered and their output)
$ docker logs container-id

To delete all stopped containers
$ docker container prune -f

-f -> force
This will delete everything about container like logs and stuff


To run a command while running the image or creating container
$ docker run alpine ping google.com

alpine -> its a linux os
after alpine we are running commmand

To run same command but keep it running in background we use
$ docker run -d alpine ping google.com

-d -> detachable

If you stopped a running container all the files and stuff you created manually will gets reset

Getting logs from container whithin some time
$ docker logs --since 5s container-id

5s -> all logs from past 5s


Remove image
$ docker rmi image-name -f

To run image in background like 
ubuntu has bash and it exits when not in interative mode
Now to keep it running
$ docker run -t -d image-name

To run some application on specified port on localhost
Like nginx runs on 80 an
we want to run its image on port 8080
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx 

-p -> port 
8080:80 -> specified port:default port

Start a stopped container
$ docker start container-id

Whenevr we add some files or stuff in conatiner 
All those gets deleted when you stop a container and restart
To have your data there in image we need to create a new image from that image

$ docker commit -m "Added txt files" container-id image-name:version
verison is not neccessay 
can remove :version from above cmd if not req

To get all images it
$ docker images -q

Suppose you want to remove all images
$ docker rmi $(docker images -q)
